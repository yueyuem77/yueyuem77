# Hello there ðŸ‘‹
# Yueyue Min | Data Scientist & Analyst


## About Me

*   **Machine Learning:** Building and deploying classification and regression models (Scikit-learn) to predict outcomes and uncover patterns.
*   **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Extracting meaning from text data through sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and feature engineering (NLTK, SpaCy, TextBlob).
*   **Data Storytelling:** Creating compelling visualizations (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Shiny) and dashboards to communicate findings effectively to stakeholders.
*   **Full-Cycle Analysis:** From data acquisition (APIs, web scraping) and cleaning (Pandas) to analysis, modeling, and presentation.
